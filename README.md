# Investment-Account
Program that takes in user input for APR%, initial investment amount, monthly deposit, and length of time to inquire and outputs the investment total.

The interface is easy to understand and follow along with what input is expected.
The output calculates precisely and can be very helpful to learn about investing.
Some further input validation should be added to the code. Currently, when something other than an integer is typed, an endless error appears. 
Overall, this code can serve as a basis for OOP and determining which code blocks go into which class.
