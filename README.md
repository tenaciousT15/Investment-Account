# Investment-Account

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Program that takes in user input for APR%, initial investment amount, monthly deposit, and length of time to inquire and outputs the investment total.

What did you do particularly well?
The interface is easy to understand and follow along with what input is expected.
The output calculates precisely and can be very helpful to learn about investing.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Some further input validation should be added to the code. Currently, when something other than an integer is typed, an endless error appears.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of writing the code was defining the calculations for the getEndingBalance() and the getInterestEarned() functions. 
Being able to break it down to determine how to calculate it properly helped me to overcome this challenge. 
I also referred back to the assignment page frequently to make sure my math was working out like the example.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project covered many Object Oriented Programming topics, like class structure and encapsulating certain variables.
Two separate InvestmentAccount objects were created in main() to display the results with or without a monthyly deposit. 
Overall, this code can serve as a basis for OOP and determining which code blocks go into which class.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is Object Oriented and can be manipulated and maintained at the function defnition level. 
In the main() function, the menu is displayed clearly for the user to see the specific output. 
The menu structure can be altered easily from main().
